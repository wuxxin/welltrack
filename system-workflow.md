### Project Awareness & Context

- **Always read `planning.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `tasks.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `planning.md`.

### Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 800 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

### Testing & Reliability

- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
    - Include at least:
        - 1 test for expected use
        - 1 edge case
        - 1 failure case

### Task Completion

- **Mark completed tasks in `tasks.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `tasks.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.
- Add new dependencies installed during a task execution, add this dependency to the dependency list, for example for python this is `pyproject.toml`.

### üìö Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Update `README.md`** when encountered problems and the used solutions in section "Problems and Solutions".
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `tasks.md`.

### Python Style & Conventions

- **Use uv** (the virtual environment and package manager) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.
- At the start of a new session
    - recreate python environment with "uv venv"
    - install packages with "uv pip install . -e"
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- Use `FastAPI` for APIs and `SQLAlchemy` or `SQLModel` for ORM if applicable.
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:

  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description
      Returns:
          type: Description
      """
  ```
