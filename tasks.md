## **Future Tasks (Planned)**

* \[ \] **Refactoring: State Management & Frontend Framework**
  * \[ \] Migration of the entire application logic and state management from the WellTrackApp object to a more robust solution like **Alpine.js**, **Vue.js**, or **Svelte**.
  * \[ \] Conversion of manual DOM manipulations (innerHTML assignments) to declarative directives/components.
* \[ \] **Reliable Native Notifications:** For a full mobile app experience, implement reliable, scheduled notifications by wrapping the PWA in a native container like **Capacitor**.
