## Planned Tasks

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **Refactor Submenu Layouts**: Update the submenu layout on the Event, Mood, Pain, History, and Settings tabs. The title will be on its own line, and the submenu will be on the next line, right-aligned, with items flowing from right to left and wrapping downwards.
- [x] **Refactor Log Page Layout**: Adjust the log/protocol page so the title and protocol selector form a fixed unit attached to the header bar, preventing them from moving with the content.
- [x] **Refactor PushButton Event Layout**: In the Event Entry tab, modify the "PushButton" layout to ensure the title (e.g., "Titel [(4x, zuletzt um hh:mm)]") is on one line and the action buttons ("Einnahme", "Rückgängig", "Erneute Einnahme") are on a second, right-aligned line. This will create a stable UI that does not change size based on the button state.
