  - Standardized all tab and section heading sizes for a consistent look and feel.
  - Adjusted history chart bar widths to be more substantial and removed the moving average line for clarity.

- **Features & Logic:**

  - Refined the mood slider to prevent accidental selections when scrolling.
  - Enhanced confirmation dialogs to support custom button text (e.g., "LÃ¶schen," "Abbrechen").
  - Added a safety check to prevent the deletion of event types that are currently in use.
