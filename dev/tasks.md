## Completed Tasks

- **GUI Test Implementation**: Create a suite of GUI tests using pytest-playwright. The tests should cover the initial application states (no data, empty data, sample data) and basic navigation. The test runner should be integrated into the `Makefile` under the `test` target. All tests will run in a 1080x1920 portrait mode, and screenshots of failed tests will be saved.
